    <h1 class="headder">Dark Souls 1 overview</h1>
    <h2>Before the begining, part 1:
    <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Age_of_Ancients">The age of Ancients</a></h2>
    <img class="imgbig" src="img/Everlasting Dragons.png" alt="Dragon">
    <p>In the begining the world was cast in grey,
    not light nor dark, not life nor death.
    <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon">
    Immortal dragons made of stone </a>
    ruled the surface wether they could move or not.
    Eventually, deep underground, a <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/First_Flame">
    flame</a> was lit by semingly nothing, and within
    it <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Souls_of_Lords">
    four powerful souls</a> where found by the
    ancient, slumbering pygmys.</p> <img class="imgbig" src="img/Furtive Pygmy.png" alt="Pygmy">
    <p>The four souls where the soul of life, death,
    light, and dark. The soul of life was found by the
    one who became known as the <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Witch_of_Izalith">
    Witch Izalith</a> and gave her power over flames.
    The soul of death was found by he who became
    <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Gravelord_Nito">
    Lord Nito</a>, the first of the dead and gave
    him powers over all things dead. The soul of light
    was found by the one that became <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Gwyn,_Lord_of_Cinder">
    Lord Gwyn</a>, the lord of sunlight and granted him power
    from the new born sun. And lastly the soul of dark
    which was found by the easily forgotten
    <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Furtive_Pygmy">
    furtive pygmy</a> who laid low and slowly
    split his soul into <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Humanity_(item)">
    fragments</a> which where spread amongst the humans.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Part 2: The war aginst dragons</h2>
    <img class="img" src="img/Gwyn Lightning.png" alt="Gwyn spear">
    <br>
    <p>Once the four souls had been collected, Gwyn
    wanted to take over the surface by slaying the
    dragons. In Gwyn's crusade against the dragons where
    at first futile, however he soon learned that his
    Lord Soul obtained from the fire allowed him to
    <a href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Sunlight_Spear">
    throw spears of lightning made from the
    power of the sun</a> which could chip away at the
    dragon's stone scales thus exposing their flesh
    underneath.</p> <img class="img" src="img/Nito Miasma.gif" alt="Nito death">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Once some of the scales where removed from the dragons, Nito could use his Lord
    Soul to release a miasma of death and disease to lay the dragons to rest forever.
    While this was happening, the Witch Izalith together with her daughters burned the
    Archtrees that the dragons lived in to not give them anywhere to flee.</p>
